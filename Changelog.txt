-- 1.81 CHANGES --

• New Feature! Face "reflection" in visor! Every few minutes Doomguy face will flash in the visor glass. Of course this is toggleable off or on in the UDV options! Defaults to OFF.

• Cleaned up Menus - separated into multiple smaller sections.
• New Toggle for Player Name display, ability to toggle stats and time serparately.

-- 1.80 CHANGES --

• Added completely new alternate visor pack. It is a C2 module and has HQ and LQ versions. Load it after A and B modules, and have fun! Has some new display features that the regular visor does not.
• Two new AI voices, both male! One is a computerized TTS voice I created, the other was a user made voice pack. Try them out!
• Health warnings now calculated by percentage of health. 100%+, 100%, 50%, 25%, 0%. This will make it more accurate for mods that modify the player max health.
• Added new startup messages. Some are for flavor, others will specify the current UDV settings and display your player name. More immersion!
• Added new option in UDV Options to specify source port you are playing: (G)Zdoom or Zandronum. If you are playing multiplayer, MAKE SURE THIS IS ACCURATE! Otherwise you WILL have problems with certain features.
• Added some new damage resistance to the HEV.

-- 1.71 CHANGES --

• Fixed speed issues with bleeding options. All difficulties should use the correct speed now.
• Added new Low Quality Alternate Graphics pack for slower systems.
• Added Startup Message when loading level.
• Fixed a few incorrect coding mistakes I caught.

-- 1.70 CHANGES --

• Added armor power drain when using flashlight if minimum power requirement is set. Drops by 1% for every 10 seconds. Use it wisely!
• Added new indicator under mugshot for UDV - Hardcore mode. Now shows "Energized" for >180 Health, and "Fatigued" when hobbled from <20 health.
• New menu option to toggle critical bleeding/energized on any difficulty!
• New menu option to toggle realistic aiming mode on any difficulty!
• New menu options to control EMS Minimum Health/Armor!
• Changed blood loss timing to random between 5 and 15 seconds for UDV - Hardcore. You'll never know exactly how long till you bleed out, so you better hurry!
• Fixed bug with EMS that would permanently lower your speed on difficulties less than UDV - Hardcore.
• Possibly enhanced performance with Radar. Still will slow down on abnormally large maps like Memorial and Doom:One. Will start out fine, but after awhile you will notice slow down.
• Fixed bug with Radar Enable sounds not playing.
• Removed Visible Radar Scanner due to being overly complicated and resource intensive, while being fairly pointless.
• Updated HEV add-in to correctly protect against fire damage for certain special fire damage sectors. (Specifically BDv20b Starter Pack maps.)
• Fixed HEV and Goggles add-ins flashing when low. Will flash on and off correctly when at 15% battery.
• HEV and Goggles add-ins now droppable when partially used. They will be unable to be picked back up, but if they are really low and you find a replacement, now you don't have to turn it on and wait for it to drain!
• Optional Alternate Graphics add in now included! Created by user "Lightsource". He is amazing!!
• Fixed Player name display for Multiplayer.
• Disabled Radar and Flashlight in Multiplayer due to many bugs (WIP for any fixes I can figure out).
• Updated some Inventory Icons.

-- 1.61 CHANGES --

• Removed optional pk3 for low quality flashlight, integrated LQ flashlight into UDV options. Now toggleable on/off.
• Fixed bug with UDV difficulties that was affecting non UDV difficulties.
• Combined UDV AI voice toggle into one option.

-- 1.60 CHANGES --

• New UDV - Hardcore difficulty. All the difficulty of UDV - Truly Brutal, with blood loss of 1 HP per 15 seconds at 20 or lower health and 50% slower movement speed. BUT at 180+ health, you get a 50% speed boost!
• Added new Emergency Medical System(EMS). Mainly for use with UDV - Hardcore, but available on all skill levels.
	• When under 20 health, and over 80 armor - you can activate it for a heal over time that will randomly heal your HP from 21-40 at the cost of 40 armor.
	• Default key is "N", and configurable in controls.
• New lower quality flashlight add-in. For those having performance issues, you can load this up and lose slight brightness for a performance boost.


-- 1.51 CHANGES --

• Re-did radar icons for displaying enemy height. Now shows upward pointing arrow for above, downwards pointing arrow for below.
• Bugfix for some shadows/lighting effects affected by the mod.
• Added new optional add-in to remove DoomVisor font from menus. This will also remove it from on screen pickup messages, so use if the menu font really bothers you.

-- 1.50 CHANGES --

• Now requires add-in for full functionality in mods. If you only load the BASE file, it will technically "work", but you will not have full advanced functionality. See HOWTOUSE.TXT for details.
• New UDV Difficulty added when starting a new game. If you want a challenge on any mod, try out "UDV - Truly Brutal" when you choose your skill. "Realistic" aiming, slower movement, faster and harder hitting enemies.
• Supports Brutal Doom v20 via add-in!
• Now supports Brutal Doom J 20 via add-in!
• UDV now has a built-in flashlight! But be careful, the hellspawn aren't completely idiotic... while it's on, they WILL notice it and be alerted to your presence! Default bind is "Y", available to set in control config!
• Flashlight can be set to shut off if armor is below a certain level. Defaults to always available, but configurable through UDV Menu.
• Flashlight can be used in two positions: Center, and Shoulder. Choose your favorite and light up your path! Available in UDV Menu.
• Ability to darken the default lighting levels in WAD from UDV Menu. Choose between Dark, Darker, and Pitch Black levels. Great with the flashlight! 
• New radar tracking system! For v19, you will need to load the Radar add in separately. For all other mods, it will be built in. Configure controls via in game control menu. Can display all movement, or all visible monsters/items(WIP).
	• Radar will show all lower tier monsters position relative to player.
		• Red is on same level as player.
		• Orange is above player.
		• Olive is below player.
	• Monsters with 1000 or more health will show up as gold.	
• Enemy health bar display! Defaults to on, shows up in top center of visor. Can show just the bar, or bar and numerical health. Toggle in UDV options.
• Enemy name display! Human type enemies will display a random rank and last name if toggled in health bar display. All other unknown monsters will be shown as a "Class X Entity" ranking 1-8 depending on their level of health. As always, toggle off or on under the healthbar display options inside UDV.
• Weapons display in top left of visor. Keep track of what weapons you do or don't have! Never wonder "Do I have the plasma rifle?" again! Toggle it in UDV options.
• Visor will display "DUAL" underneath the weapon name if you have two of the same weapon on certain mods! Never forget again that you are carrying two rifles or plasma guns!
• Added "Engagement Time" (level time) to level stats display. Displays in the top middle of visor. Great for speedrunners! Disable level stats in the menu to remove it.
• Added Combat Recorder timer display. Counts down until the next autosave. Displays at bottom left of visor. Useful in a firefight to know how long until your next autosave!
• Keys will now display a double icon when carrying two of the same color (card, skull) instead of 6 separate images.
• New Inventory add-ins for Radiation Suit and Light Amp goggles. If you load these add-ins, you can carry these items with you, two at a time and toggle them on and off with a key! Never waste that precious power again!
	• Light amp goggles default key is (K), configured through in game control menu.
	• Radiation Suit is now HEV suit. Halves damage from fire and fce, quarters damage from electricity, and nullifies poison and acid. Default key is (J), configure through in game control menu.
	• When toggling HEV suit, there is a 2 second delay that will freeze you in place as you "put on" the suit. This balances having a persistent suit with damage reduction and makes it more realistic.
• Integrated display for my other add-on Pipebombs, Jawbones, and Flares. They will now show up in all supported mods by default, if you are using them without the need for an extra UDV add-in.
• MANY new crosshairs to choose from.
• HUD no longer requires screen size to be set to 11. Will work on all sizes.

-- 1.43a CHANGES --

• Font fix(yet again) - Made the fonts in the menus and intermission screens smaller. Hopefully this will fix the issues people have been having.
• Updated some sounds with some higher quality versions made by the amazing Quaker540!

-- 1.43 CHANGES --

• New low clip warning chime. When clip ammo gets below 20% and the clip capacity is greater than 2, a short warning chime will play(does not play for SSG, and other weapons with low clip capacity counts.). Helps to know when you are nearing the end of a clip, or like me forget you are not using a full clip when switching between weapons.
• Visor display will turn off during external camera sequences! This should work for any rolls, deaths, fatalities, etc. that switch out of first person view. This was a tough one to figure out and work around, it might be buggy - let me know!
• New flatline sound on death. Now when you die, you will hear a flatline sound.
• Ammo low warnings increased from 15% to 20%.
• Fixed bug with low ammo and depleted warnings going off at the same time when switching to a weapon with no ammo.
• Fixed display bug with primary ammo count on 16:9 displays.

-- 1.42a CHANGES --

• Fonts are fixed! (For the last time hopefully) I re-did the fonts, and everything should work now WITHOUT having to set scale text to DOUBLE or ON. You can have no text scaling, and everything should be readable now.
• Unknown weapons will now show "-----" instead of "UNKN".
• New fonts mean slight tweaks to the locations of the ammo counters.
• Menus are now in DoomVisor colors.
• Meatshields now display correctly on Visor!

-- 1.42 CHANGES --

• New reserve ammo display! Enabled by default, this will display in the right side of the visor and have a running count of all ammo available. Option to toggle this in DoomVisor Options.
• Combat Recorder (Autosave) mode! Disabled by default, this allows you to enable an autosave every 1-10 minutes. Very helpful if you are like me and forget to save, then lose tons of progress. You'll never be further than 10 minutes from where you left off! Shows a red recording light on the bottom left of visor when enabled.
• Weapon names now shown on visor display instead of boring AMMO.
• Found a workaround for the annoying audio bombardment when starting a new game. Armor depleted warning should now no longer play until you have gotten at least 1 armor, then lost it.
• Higher quality AI sounds thanks to Quaker540! He optimized and re-did my audio tracks, changed some of the warning beeps, and increased volume!
• New option to Toggle off/on Visor on screen messages. Available in DoomVisor Options.

-- 1.41 CHANGES --

• New high resolution damage graphics for bullet holes and explosion damage on visor.
• New toggle option for disabling auto switching weapons on pickup. This is just a personal preference of mine, and I have made it an option for anyone else who wants it.
• Re-did damage graphics and the way they are loaded. Should improve performance overall. Unfortunately this increases the overall size of the HUD, but the performance increase should be worth it.
• Changed ammo warning levels from 50% and 25% to 40% and 15%. This seems like an overall better option so it isn't constantly whining about low ammo.

-- 1.40b CHANGES --

• Bugfix for menus. Certain mods lost their special menu functions with the last version, those should be fixed now. Thanks Alex-Wolfenstein97 for finding this!
• Bugfix for ammo depleted count. I noticed that on some weapons, the ammo depleted warning would go off with 1 bullet left. Changed the way it works, now should only go off for truly empty ammo counts!

-- 1.40a CHANGES --

• Bugfix for melee weapons. There was a bug that would show a low ammo warning for melee weapons that would show up randomly. This has been fixed.
• All options have been moved to the main Options screen. It is now located at Options -> Ultimate DoomVisor HUD.
• You can now set all options necessary for the HUD to display correctly directly from the Ultimate DoomVisor Options screen. Set these options to their recommended settings, and everything should display perfectly!
• PA1NKI113R's Add-In has been updated to support the new V7.

-- 1.40 CHANGES --

• Brand new warning sounds! HUD now has an "AI" (and I use the term intelligence very loosely) system. Warning beep and voice will play under the following conditions: When health is critical, Armor is zero, Ammo is critical, and Ammo is empty. Thanks to killbotvii for inspiring me to do this, and his friend Kate for recording the voices!
• Warning text! In addition to the warning sounds, text will show on screen to warn you of the same conditions.
• Warning sounds are on by default, but are a toggle option under Options -> HUD Options -> DoomVisor HUD -> Enable Sounds.
• Foolproof Ammo display! A basic Ammo display will always be shown, even if a weapon is not fully supported. This will show up in white and show "UNKN" instead of "AMMO". For example, if Quaker540 updates his submod and adds a new weapon - you will now be able to continue to use my HUD until an update is available. All supported weapons will be unaffected. This serves three purposes, the first being adapting to new weapons. The second purpose is that the HUD should now partially support ANY mod. The third purpose is to help out those that still can't figure out load order. Even if you load things in the wrong order, you will still have a semi-functional Ammo display.
• Warning sounds/text will not function with unsupported weapons.

-- 1.35e CHANGES --

• Option to toggle mugshot damage off! For those that always want to see that beautiful Doomguy mugshot, you now will have the option to always display it, no matter how little armor you have. Just go into the DoomVisor HUD options and turn "Dynamic Mugshot Damage" to OFF.
• New font! I made a new font. It is more uniform, and supports more characters.
• All messages on screen will now display in DoomVisor digital font. This makes it less jarring when finding secrets, picking up items. Now it is more connected to the total experience. Because of this change, you need to make sure Options -> HUD Options -> Message Options -> Scale Text In High Res is set to DOUBLE or ON. If you do not do this, you might be unable to read any on screen messages.
• All menus (except for the title screen and end of level) display in DoomVisor digital font.

-- 1.35d CHANGES --

• Option to toggle damage! Due to a few requests, I went ahead and added a new option in the DoomVisor HUD option menu for disabling the damage graphics. I personally don't prefer it this way, as it takes away half of what makes this HUD immersive - but hey, if the damage gets on your nerves and you just want the rest of the counters, colors, etc... then here you go!
• Bugfix for damage on resolutions other than 4:3 when showing damage. Due to a coding fail on my end, when the armor hit 20%, it only drew one damage level instead of the four it should have. Once you hit 10%, it would show the full damage again. This has been fixed, and damage should show consistently as it was meant to!
• Separated the ACS scripting into two modules. This is to make it easier for me to update it in the future with other submod weapon layouts. This will unfortunately break loading current savegames you might have because it will be a different number of ACS modules. If you are doing a playthrough and loading from save games, I highly recommend you either wait until you finish that run before using the new version of my HUD, or just go all out and be prepared to start fresh. :D

-- V1.35c CHANGES --

• New indicator for when you have berserk strength (berserk pack, demon strength rune). The UAC logo in the bottom left corner will now light up and pulse slowly to remind you that you have berserk strength. I find that I forget I have that from time to time, and this serves as an non-intrusive reminder.
• Hand Grenade ammo no longer displays if you are completely out. This was originally how it was meant to be, but I apparently left that code out at some point and didn't realize it. Anyway, it is fixed now.
• Slight tweak for my persistent Radiation Suit / Light Amp mod. The Light Amp goggles will no longer count toward your item counts for the level. I changed this because with my mod you can't always pick up every Light Amp you come across. This allows you to still get 100% items, but enjoy saving your Light Amps for a dark day.

-- v1.35b CHANGES --

• Fatalities should now properly remove HUD from view consistently. No more keybar/grenade counters staying on screen during those beautiful deaths!
• Ammo counter for Pa1n's V6C new weapon Compact SMG now supported.
• Automap Inventory bar should now work properly again. Got broken in one of the previous updates, and I just noticed it.

-- v1.35 CHANGES --

• New bar graphics for health and ammo. Cleaned up and sharper, looks much better now. Also new graphics for stats display, also sharper and cleaner.
• Support for PA1n's new inventory items for v6. They will show up in the inventory bar on the bottom left display for easy access.
• 4:3 support now back to old method. No cut off edges, everything is scrunched but you can see everything now.
• A few new armor damage levels. The more damage your armor takes, the worse off it is. Some new cracks, some new blood, some scuffs... nothing too intrusive, but here's another reason to keep your armor in good condition!
• Weapons that don't use a secondary ammo clip (chaingun, bfg, etc.) will only show one ammo display and will not show the / separator.
• Support for bdpv24.
• Support for Vanilla Doom.

-- v1.34 CHANGES --

• Newly optimized, should work with absolutely any resolution! While researching information on making this work with Zandronum, I discovered I had been doing more work than necessary for different resolutions. Every resolution should work now, and I have removed all redundant graphics for the old method. Filesize reduced by about 4MB!
• 4:3 mode no longer looks squished, and supports all functions! Because of the new way to handle resolution scaling, everything fits. 4:3 users rejoice!
• Zandronum 2.0 support! Now supports Zandronum 2.0 via optional add-in pk3. Just load it after the main pk3, and you should be good to go! Minor downside is there is no way for me to easily set things like Stats, Mugshot, or the inventory display as a toggle with Zandronum. They are always on in Zandronum, until a way to toggle is available. Also, I am working on making it compatible with the stable version of Zandronum 1.2.2, but it might be heavily stripped down in terms of features due to lack of advanced functions.
• Visor HUD turns off during fatalities! Awesome suggestion, and I found a way to implement it. Now you aren't looking through a visor watching yourself perform one of those beautiful fatalities! Much better immersion this way.

-- v1.33 CHANGES --

• Light Amplification Visor battery level! When you pick up a Light Amplification Visor, a battery icon will appear in your right display. It will drain as your Visor runs out of power.
• Radiation Suit level! When you pick up a Radiation Suit, a biohazard icon will appear on your right display and slowly disappear as your suit runs out of protection.
• Keys have been moved slightly left on the display to make room for the new icons.
• Inventory! An inventory bar has been added to the automap display, if you have any items in your inventory. For those of you that play WADs that use inventory, this is for you!
• Inventory on Visor! You can show your current inventory on the bottom left side of the right display in 16:9 and 16:10 resolutions, 4:3 is too squeezed to fit it. This is made mainly for PA1N's submod and the Sentry Gun inventory item. I have created a custom graphic for the Sentry Gun to show there. Other items may not work as well, as their icon will not scale well or fit the theme. For now this is a toggle option, and only for those that want it.
• Optional add in that changes the Radiation Suit and Light Amplification Visor to inventory items that can be used on demand. You can carry 2 Light Visors, and 1 Radiation Suit. This is totally optional, but I like it better than use on pickup versions, it feels more strategic and real. I have created custom graphics for those two items to work with the Inventory on Visor capability, and when used together, the visor becomes even more dynamic and useful!
• Minor change to visor damage graphics. I noticed a smudge on the visor that was really only visible in bright environments. I have removed it. If you noticed it and it bugged you, it is gone!


-- v1.32b CHANGES --

• All PNG files have been optimized for a smaller overall file size. The optimization is lossless, so it should not have any effect on the look, just saves space, and makes for quicker loading for the engine!

-- v1.32 NEW FEATURES --

• Full 16:10 support up to at least 1920x1200! Higher resolutions should work in theory, but I have no way to test myself.
• New keybar location resides below the Ammo display at the bottom right.
• New key graphics to better integrate into the overall look of HUD.
• New FONT! Thanks to Nikulas' effort in designing some new high resolution fonts, the numbers and lettering have never looked better!

-- v1.31 NEW FEATURES --

• Full 4:3 support up to at least 1600x1200! Higher resolutions should work in theory, but I have no way to test it since I have no monitors that support higher resolution than that.

-- v1.3 NEW FEATURES --

• Now replaces the full screen HUD, to make it possible for the main new feature...
• Full 16:9 support up to at least 1920x1080! Higher resolutions may work, but I have no way of testing.
• 4:3 support has been removed temporarily until I can get it optimized and fully working with all the features. If you play in 4:3, don't bother downloading right now.
• Level stats and mugshot can now be turned on or off independently from the HUD Options menu. Just look for DoomVisor HUD, toggle your preference and viola!
• Air supply display will show up at bottom of screen as a semi-transparent bar over the respirator mouthpiece. For those of you playing WADs that go underwater, you can now avoid drowning! (Dark7 being my favorite so far!)
